        <h3 class="skill-sub">MADE IN US</h3>
        <P class="skill-text">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from
            certain Coffea species. From the
            coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds
            are then
            roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into a
            powder and
            typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</P>

        <h3 class="skill-sub">ENERGY</h3>
        <P class="skill-text">An energy drink is a type of drink containing stimulant compounds, usually caffeine, which
            is marketed as providing
            mental and physical stimulation (marketed as "energy", but distinct from food energy). They may or may not
            be carbonated
            and may also contain sugar, other sweeteners, herbal extracts, taurine, and amino acids. They are a subset
            of the larger
            group of energy products, which includes bars and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are
            advertised to enhance
            sports performance. There are many brands and varieties in this drink category.</P>

        <h3 class="skill-sub">MUSIC</h3>
        <P class="skill-text">Music is the art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements
            of melody, harmony, rhythm,
            and timbre.[1] It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of
            music include
            common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo,
            meter, and
            articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are
            sometimes
            termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may 6emphasize, de-emphasize or
            omit some of
            these elements.</P>

        <h3 class="skill-sub">FAMILY RECEIPE</h3>
        <P class="skill-text">First I made as the recipe was written (including sprinkling the cocoa powder and cinnamon
            on top), but the coffee
            tasted a bit too strong, and not sweet enough to my liking. Then I added 1 more teaspoon of sugar, and
            reheated the
            coffee a bit in the microwave; stirred well, and ended up topping the coffee with some Reddi Wip, and
            sprinkling a bit
            more of the cocoa powder over the whipped topping. And the coffee tasted so much better! By the way, the
            cocoa powder I
            used... was from a box of Land-O-Lakes Cocoa Classics "Chocolate Supreme" Hot Cocoa Mix, which I purchased a
            variety
            pack at Sam's Club. Thank you Girl from India, for sharing this recipe</P>
